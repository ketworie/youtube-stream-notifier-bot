# youtube-stream-notifier-bot

Supported commands:
/add - add channel to get notifications abouts live and upcoming streams
/list - list added channels
/remove - remove channel from added

Currently, YouTube API has a quota of 10k requests per day, so ALL registered channels are checked with a delay of one minute :'(

WORK IN PROGRESS, some features may be added later, although I do not really need them, this bot is created for personal use mostly.
